                <p>We do not have a published list of all of the third parties with whom we share your data with, as this would be heavily dependent on your specific use of our Services. However, if you would like further information about who we have shared
                    your data with, or to be provided with a list specific to you, you can request this by writing to <a href="#">support@entrebiz-pte.com</a>.</p>
                <h2>Where we store your personal data</h2>
                <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination at Europe. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the Storage Area, who work for us or for one of our Affiliates. Such staff maybe engaged
                    in, among other things, the fulfilment of your payment order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.  We will
                    take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
                </p>
                <h2>Sharing your data outside of the storage area</h2>
                <p>In order to provide our Services to you, it is sometimes necessary for us to transfer your data to the third parties outlined in section 6.1 that are based outside of the Storage Area. In these cases, we ensure that both ourselves and
                    our partners take adequate and appropriate technical, physical and organisational security measures to protect your data. We also ensure we have appropriate contractual protections in place with these third parties.</p>
                <h2>Profiling and Automated Decision Making</h2>
                <p>We may use some instances of your data in order to customise our Services and the information we provide to you, and to address your needs - such as your country of address and transaction history. For example, if you frequently send funds
                    from one particular currency to another, we may use this information to inform you of new product updates or features that may be useful for you. When we do this, we take all necessary measures to ensure that your privacy and security
                    are protected - and we only use pseudonymised data where ever possible. This activity has no legal effect on you.</p>
                <p>As part of being a highly technical and innovative company, we may use Automated Decision Making (ADM) in order to improve your experience, or to help fight financial crime so that we can provide you with a fast and efficient service.
                    We may use ADM to verify your identity documents, or to confirm the accuracy of the information you have provided to us. None of our ADM processes have a legal effect on you.</p>
                <h2>Data Retention</h2>
                <p>As a regulated financial institution, Entrebiz is required by law to store some of your personal and transactional data beyond the closure of your account with us. Your data is only accessed internally on a need to know basis, and it will
                    only be accessed or processed if absolutely necessary.
                </p>
                <p>We will always delete data that is no longer required by a relevant law or jurisdiction in which we operate.</p>
                <p>Retention periods may vary and strictly subject to the definition of the local jurisdiction requirements and directives.</p>
                <h2>Your rights</h2>
                <p>You have the right to correct any personal information we hold on you that is inaccurate, incorrect, or out of date.</p>
                <p>You have the right to ask us to delete your data when it is no longer necessary, or no longer subject to a legal obligation to which Entrebiz is subject to.</p>
                <h2>Access to information</h2>
                <p>Subject to applicable laws, you may have the right to access information we hold about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the relevant data protection legislation.</p>
                <h2>Changes to our privacy policy</h2>
                <p>Any changes we may make to our privacy policy will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.</p>
                <h2>Contact</h2>
                <p>Questions, comments and requests regarding this privacy policy are welcomed and should be addressed to <a href="#">support@entrebiz-pte.com</a>.</p>
